% As the thesis gets bigger and bigger, you'll only want to look at a
% single chapter at a time. This is a template that prints just a single chapter
%
% Here, the COMMENT format might be particularly useful as the
% wide margins allow you or your committee to write long notes to
% yourself about how to improve things.

%%% The first argument is the text size. The second argument changes
%%% The margins and the spacing.
%%% FINAL mode prints double spaced with figures and thesis margins.
%%% DRAFT mode prints single-spaced with 1" margins, with slightly
%%%   narrower margins for the figure captions so that they stand out.
%%% COMMENT mode prints an extra wide right margin and tiny margins
%%% everywhere else. This allows your committee plenty of room to add
%%% comments.
%%% Margins can be changed in the last lines of the ucthesis.cls
%%% with the geometry command.

% PITHY QUOTE
% In the draft version, I like to put a fun quote at the beginning of each
% chapter to keep myself entertained. I considered putting these in
% the final version as well, but I'll let you decide that for yourself.
% Note that the quote does affect spacing, if you're trying to look at
% how the final version of the chapter will appear in LaTeX...
