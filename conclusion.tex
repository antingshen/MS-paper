We have presented numerous improvements to existing video annotation tools.
We first argued that optimizing for researcher time is as important, if not more important than optimizing for worker efficiency, and showed our contributions in that area.
Then we demonstrated several ideas that allow for easier annotation by the workers that we discovered in our experiments.
We showed how BeaverDam enables cheaper annotations to create large datasets that improve model accuracies in production. % At no point was cost analysed yet :/ I'm guessing its a TODO?

As BeaverDam is designed to be extensible, we hope that the platform will adapt to new types of annotations.
BeaverDam's modular designs shine best when new types of data, such as point clouds from LIDAR, require human labeling in the future.
