by decreasing the average T-R separation, independent of

detailed study of threshold reception in white-noise backgrounds
is included, along with calculations of Bayes risk, bias terms,
and minimum detectable signals for broad-band RC-noise signals and
narrow-band, i.e., high-Q, LRC-noise signal processes. Optimum
detector structures for signal processes with rational intensity
spectra are also determined for the white noise case, and
particular attention is paid to optimum receiver design in terms
of physically realizable elements. Suboptimum receiver structure
and performance are considered briefly, as well as a number of
limiting cases of more special interest. General methods of attack
are illustrated, with details given in Appendixes I-V. Application

also shown that the Bernoulli sequential test is defined by three

andc(p_0, p_1)rather than four, as one would normally expect. The
significance of these transformations is briefly discussed.
Finally, the theory of Bernoulli sequential detection is applied
to the detection of a sine-wave carrier in noise when the
signal-to-noise ratio is less than one. The efficiency of this
detector is calculated and compared with the results of others.
Curves of the significant Bernoulli sequential detector
