%%% The first argument is the text size. The second argument changes
%%% The margins and the spacing.
%%% FINAL mode prints double spaced with figures and thesis margins.
%%% DRAFT mode prints single-spaced with 1" margins, with slightly
%%%   narrower margins for the figure captions so that they stand out.
%%% COMMENT mode prints an extra wide right margin and tiny margins
%%% everywhere else. This allows your committee plenty of room to add
%%% comments.
%%% Margins can be changed in the last lines of the ucthesis.cls
%%% with the geometry command.

% EACH PATH MUST END IN A '/'
% In other words, \includegraphics{Fig1} will first look in the current
% directory, but if it can't find the file Fig1, it will  look for
% SUBDIRECTORY/Fig1 . If that's not there, it will look next in
% SUBDIRECTORY2/Fig1 . If it finds that, it will ignore anything after
% SUBDIRECTORY2.
