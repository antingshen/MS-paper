Thanks to Professor Keutzer and everyone in our group for the motivation and advice, Kosta for the great support, and Bichen Wu \& Byung Gon Song for sharing in the struggles.

I'd also like to acknowledge Allen Wang, Sean Zhu, and Gabriel Arreola for contributing code to this project, coming up with awesome logos, and puns.
